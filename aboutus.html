    <p>One of the many questions I receive is where did your name come from.
    </p>
    <p>Well it is an interesting story. My parents were on a trip to Tahiti and saw a poster for an actress named Tarita. The name was translated in English as pretty girl. They liked the name and said that if they ever have another daughter, they would name her Tarita.</p>
